<br/>

* Implemented the DICeNod algorithm for identifying nodes with highest information 
ow in social networks
using compressive sensing without full knowledge of the network topological structure.

* Verified and elucidated the recovery guarantees of the Sparse Centrality Vector from the proposed Sensing
Matrix using properties of Lossless Bipartite Expander Graph by writing formal proofs
