* Designed and Developed an application which solves definite integrals from handwritten camera images

* Implemented End-to-End Sequence Models with a CNN based Encoder and an RNN based Decoder to
predict LATEX sequences of math expressions from its handwritten camera image

* Proposed a Parsing Algorithm for extracting syntax information from relative coordinates of expressions

* Deployed the API for the application using Flask micro web framework on cloud
