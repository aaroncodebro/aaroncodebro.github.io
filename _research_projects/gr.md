<br/>

* Worked on real-time gesture recognition using UAV camera, for efficient control of UAV in an outdoor setting

* Adapted the methods from Temporal Pyramidal Network(CVPR 2020) for action recognition and achieved
an Top-1 accuracy of 94.29 % , with 716.89 fps and latency of 0.0893 seconds, improving the current SOTA of
91.9 % set by Pose-CNN on the UAV-GESTURE dataset

* Proposed a Time-Series based approach using key features like Pose Coordinates, angles, angular velocity, and
distances between joints for input to an LSTM based architecture for gesture classification.
